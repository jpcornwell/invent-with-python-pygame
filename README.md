Making Games with Python & Pygame
=================================
In this repo I will be following along with the book "Making Games with
Python & Pygame" by Al Sweigart. Since simply rewriting the games verbatim
would be kind of boring, I will be adding my own twist to them.

I am using this as a refresher course on general game programming, and more
specifically on how to use pygame. I could probably just dive into the
documentation, but this will at least give me some ideas on what to create.
